Write a function that inputs a string. The function should return the string sorted in
ascending order of the length of the words.
Example Test Case:
Input: "This is a cool sentence"
Output: "a is this cool sentence"

program:

def ascword():
    a=input()
    words=a.split()
    sort=sorted(words,key=len)
    end=' '.join(sort)
    print(end)
ascword()
