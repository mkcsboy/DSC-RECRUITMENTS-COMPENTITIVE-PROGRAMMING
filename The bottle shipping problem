The bottle shipping problem
A company manufactures packing cartons in four sizes: small, medium, large and xl.
These cartons can hold 6 bottles, 12 bottles, 24 bottles and 48 bottles respectively.
Write a function that inputs the number of bottles to be shipped by the company. The
function should print the break-up of the number of cartons used in descending order of
capacity.
Example Test Case:
Input: 140
Output: 2 xl, 1 large, 1 medium, 1 small

program:

def carbot():
    bottles=int(input())
    s,m,l,xl=6,12,24,48
    no_xl=no_l=no_m=no_s=0
    while bottles>=s:
        if (bottles>=xl):
            no_xl=bottles//xl
            bottles-=(no_xl*xl)
        elif (bottles>=l):
            no_l=bottles//l
            bottles-=(no_l*l)
        elif (bottles>=m):
            no_m=bottles//m
            bottles-=(no_m*m)
        elif (bottles>=s):
            no_s=bottles//s
            bottles-=(no_s*s)
        else:
            break
    print(no_xl,"xl,",no_l,"large,",no_m,"medium,",no_s,"small")
